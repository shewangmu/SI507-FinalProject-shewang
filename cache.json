Battery life is indeed better, but relative to other tablets (e.g. iPad) the battery life still leaves a lot to be desired. Maybe 7 hours with normal use; other Windows devices can do a lot better. Windows just still doesn\u2019t act as a good tablet OS; apps run hidden in the background, some apps aren\u2019t optimized for touch, and it\u2019s slow in ways that surprise (e.g. launching apps), and the Windows App Store still has a ton of garbage software. Very few of the apps you\u2019d expect to see on a tablet/mobile device. The fact that it also doesn\u2019t haven any USB-C ports came as a pretty big disappointment too.\r\n\r\nSo not great as a tablet; what about as a laptop? Eh. The keyboard is an extra $130 or so; it\u2019s decent but connects to the tablet in a flimsy manner that requires some yoga positions to hold steady in the lap. The kickstand is nice, no arguments there, but think about it: to type with it in your lap, you\u2019re basically balancing three thin points of connection to keep it sturdy. The iPad doesn\u2019t have much articulation and the keyboard is flat, but it\u2019s sturdy: you can pick the whole thing up by just the keyboard. The battery and power are middle-of-the-road for a windows laptop; if you get the $899 i5 model it\u2019s not a bad deal except you still have to buy a keyboard.\r\n\r\nNo pen is included anymore, so I didn\u2019t try that. On the SP4 it was okay.\r\n\r\nIf you want a Windows tablet, I can\u2019t imagine that any is better than the Surface when all is considered. However, if want you want is an iPad-like tablet, this is not the device for you. I thought I\u2019d get this instead of a new iPad Pro based on things I\u2019d read, and it clear to me that either I\u2019m just not interested in going back to Windows at all or I\u2019m just too used to the ease and reliability of iOS in a tablet."}, {"ProductId": 19, "time": "3 weeks ago", "rating": 5, "title": "Awesome", "content": "I needed to get my wife something she could use for graduate school, something portable yet being able to use the full Microsoft suite.

Ive noticed this is very snappy with all the mouse gestures, which have always been slow with my other laptop experiences (including the surface book gen 1). Screen is very bright and beautiful, keyboard is enjoyable to type on. The alcantara feels nice but now i fear eating around my laptop, but no stars docked for that because that will be on me if i dirty the keyboard. \r\nThe reason i gave this a 3 stars is for several reasons. First off, the previous surface laptop came with windows 10 pro, and now i have windows 10 home. for business use, this means that i have to pay extra money so i can use features such as remote desktop and hyper-v. The next reason is for keeping the mini display port. I know people are asking for usb-c, which i would love but all i care is for something more day-to-day, like a regular hdmi port. Now i have to buy an outdated adapter that i will only use for this device. \r\nApple is making an announcement on the 30th, If they come out something that blows this away i might jump ship. Meaning, if they have something for the same price with a better port selection (and better experience), why not buy a macbook and buy windows 10 pro ? I wasnt satisfied with the 2016 macbook pro, it was a little brick compared to this machine. And the fans kicked up allllll the time. So i'll probably have to play with the demo models when it comes out. \r\nOutside of the poor port selection and windows 10 downgrade, i am very satisfied with my experience and yes i do recommend this laptop.

Received it yesterday and found it to be more, much more, than I expected. The quality build is what you would expect from the surface line. The battery life could be better, but until the battery industry provides improved battery size, weight with performance, this is what we have to deal with for this size screen and quality with an intel chip. Most reviewers are bashing this thinking it should do what the surface pro does, how comical and disrespectful of their responsibility as professional tech authorities. My advice is to try it for yourself. Don't listen to the naysayers. This is an outstanding mobile device that has the ability to do on the go what you couldn't otherwise do with this size package. Are there improvements to be made, yes. But we didn't get the surface pro out the door before we had to deal with surface pro, 2,3, and 4...just saying :)Just a couple things on the other review.1. Upgrading to Windows Home from S mode was a breeze. Not sure what the other review was talking about, and it's free.2. Your going to have updates. This product was built and packaged way before they could update it with the latest firmware and other neccesarry improvements. Before you start using it, always go to update it to the latest software and firmware improvements. It didn't take long at all.Read more", "ProductId": 26, "time": "August 3, 2018"}, {"rating": 5, "title": "This thing is great", "content": "If you need a PC to do light work and can live with a 10 inch display, you'll love it. Or maybe you want a tablet that can be more than just that. I like the whole philosophy behind it, a device that you can take anywhere and use it in all your activities. After using it at work I can take the keyboard off and watch a movie or browse the web while listening some music or use a pen to do some digital painting as a hobby, It's just so versatile. I think this is the closest thing to what Microsoft wanted to achieve with the Surface line. Even closer than the already great Surface Pro.And there's this premium feel to it. The magnesium body feels very solid, the kickstand doesn't move if you don't want to and if you pair it with the Alcantara keyboard it's just a very different experience that you can feel. And yet it's so light. You'll have a disappointing experience touching a plastic laptop after using one of these.The downside is that it isn't precisely cheap. If you want it to be more than a tablet, you'll have to add the type cover keyboard, around $100 or more if you buy a Microsoft one (it's also great but I'm not reviewing it here). This just happens to be an affordable Surface product, and they're always expensive. But also so versatile and innovative that you'll find they worth it.It's also very sturdy. I found that out yesterday (there was a dog involved), it fell from a feet high right on the edge of the screen. I thought I would find a shattered or cracked display, but there was nothing on it. Not even on the edge, not a single dent or scratch on the whole thing, and it's working like if nothing happened (I'm using it to write this review).Most people complain about relatively short battery life but you can work for hours on it. I get it to work the whole day with the screen at its darkest and the battery saving mode on. Unless you use it outside that's enough brightness and performance for what you'll be using it. Another common complain are the thick bezels, but they're there for a reason, which becomes very obvious when you use it like a tablet.This might not be the device for you if what you want is high performance for CPU or graphic demanding tasks (and of course it's far from being a gamer PC) or if you really hate Windows. But if you're looking for a portable PC/tablet you can't go wrong with this. It's light, sturdy, completelly silent, has a sleek desing and offers a full desktop experience. And if you already own a Surface Pro you'll find this fascinating and even charming. It's a scaled down version of it.Read more", "ProductId": 26, "time": "September 16, 2018"}]}]}}
