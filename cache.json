I thought the one I had must be defective so I went to the store to check the model and it was horrible too. I called Apple and attempted to fix it but it seems that right now nothing can be done to fix the issue. I returned it as the old Macbook Air had a much better camera and I use it all the time for video calls. I mean if you are planning to update to a beautiful retina screen why would you leave an outdated camera when just about everything is done by video calls now. Very disappointing. For now I will keep the old one and hope that next year the camera will catch up to the screen capabilities."}, {"ProductId": 1, "time": "5 days ago", "rating": 5, "title": "Ideal for Students", "content": "I had the previous model of the MacBook Air, and the battery life of the new one is so much better.

The fan doesn't start and the computer doesn't get heated like the previous model. It's also super light and the sound is great too. For those of you who type in class, the keys aren't as loud as the old MacBook Air. Color wise, it's more of a bronze gold so it's not the same gold color as the iphone/ipad.

I purchased a laptop with a 1st gen butterfly keyboard and it just sat in the corner and later sold it to a friend who didn't mind it.

I use a ThinkPad and a mechanical keyboard on another computer and from time to time I miss some key hits, mostly when using the shift key quickly. I have not had a missed key press with this butterfly no matter how quickly I type or how \"messy\" (trying to force a mistake). They keyboard is growing on me. I've done a lot of typing at this point and I don't dislike it nearly as much as I used to.\r\n\r\nI'm not compiling FireFox or the Linux kernel. I'm not editing 4K video.

The MacBook Air was the best purchase I made in order to enhance my learning experience. Considering the fact that I was not at all tech savvy, I knew I needed a device that was easy to use. The first brand that came to mind for simplicity was Apple. When I first got the laptop, it came with quick steps on how to start setting it up. It also gave me tips on how to best use it for my convenience. Since I already had an IPhone, I knew the software would be familiar and compatible. The compatibility with my phone made for time saving and effortless transferring of pictures and music. It was also simple to download other software that was needed for school. I was quickly able to learn how to complete certain assignments for school in an efficient matter with the help of the MacBook Air. \r\n Another advantage to buying this product was the battery life. I honestly expected the laptop to have horrible battery life due to the fact that I had to constantly charge my other Apple device. I was pleasantly surprised when my laptop would stay on for several days because the battery would not last on my IPhone what so ever. The laptop not only stayed charged for an extended amount of time but also charged very quickly if it did die. This extended battery life enabled me to work on assignments for long hours or even binge watch my favorite Netflix series without having to stop and charge.\r\n In addition to the simplicity and battery life, the MacBook Air was aesthetically pleasing and light in weight. The style and look of the MacBook Air was known because many people, including myself, thought it had a classy design. Aside from the fact that the laptop was stylish, it was also very thin and light. I most definitely did not want a bulky laptop, and the MacBook Air lived up to its name since it was as light as air. This was very important to me because I did not want to be carrying around more weight in my book bag than I had to. The thinness of the MacBook Air was also convenient because it fit easily into several different bags. I could take the laptop anywhere I needed and it was not a hassle. \r\n Another upside to having bought this product was the several ports that were located on the sides. It contained two USB ports, a SD card slot, and another slot for something I had no idea about. That was an advantage because I did not have to purchase an adapter in order to be able to use a flash drive. Newer MacBook models do not have it to where the ports come installed, so the adapter is necessary to connect other devices to the laptop.\r\n Finally, the last thing I liked about the MacBook Air was the keyboard that lit up. If I was in a dark room or somewhere that had a dark setting, I would not have to struggle to see what I was typing. I could even adjust the brightness of the lighting from the keyboard so it would not always have to be so bright. All of these simple yet brilliant aspects come together to make a spectacular product. I would give this product a five out of five-star rating. I strongly recommend buying the MacBook Air. Not only do you get plenty for your money\u2019s worth, but you also end up very pleased with all it has to offer."}, {"ProductId": 3, "time": "1 year ago", "rating": 5, "title": "Even in 2017, the Air does pack a decent punch!", "content": "Let me begin by acknowledging that there is nothing that's not already said about a MacBook Air. Having said that, here are my two cents about the latest iteration of this classic MacBook. \r\nLet me begin with some of the things that I love:\r\n- The build quality: I mean, hands down, Apple has nailed it when it comes to designing and building laptops. The design is just perfect and light enough to carry and sturdy enough to resist easy damage at the same time. I have no complaints here! I do a ton of writing on my laptop, and I am happy with the keyboard of this computer as well. \r\n- The MacOS: Say what you will, but when it comes to a refined, uniform and snappy performance, MacOS is the boss. Everything is uniform and aesthetically pleasing. Furthermore, there so many apps on the Mac Store that not having a software is a moot point for most users. \r\n-The performance: Although Apple uses some dated chips on this line of laptops, the MacBook Air still maintains one of the snappiest laptops out there. I have had no issues with general browsing and light Photoshop work on this laptop. I can't comment on the video editing aspect of it as I don't ever edit videos on my laptop. If your needs are general browsing, email, word processing, occasional photo editing, etc., this notebook is more than capable of doing it. \r\n-Battery life: I get around 10-12 hours on a consistent basis depending on what I am doing. If you are doing light browsing, office work and occasional video or two, you are looking at 12 hours, no problem. \r\nNow for the bad. Well, there are a couple of issues that I do have with this laptop. \r\n- The screen: It is 2017 for god's sake! Can't you stick a 1080p screen on a MacBook Air, Apple?! God! The mediocrity of the screen stings even more as the laptop is not what you might call a 'budget' laptop. So, if you are looking for a sharp screen with a decent color gamut, look elsewhere. \r\n-No upgrades: Another thing that bothers me about this laptop is that you can't upgrade anything, nothing, zilch, nada! So, make sure you pick the configuration you want before buying it. \r\n-Games: Just one word- Hopeless! But I get it, you are not buying this laptop if you are a serious gamer, so I can let it slide. \r\n-The Apple Tax: This thing is, simply put, overpriced. It would be a great buy if it were $300 cheaper. But, if you want Apple ecosystem, this is your cheapest option. \r\nIn conclusion; do I recommend this laptop? If you overlook the poor screen and the Apple tax, then yes! It is a great work machine, and if you are a college student or a professional who uses office software and stuff, you would be happy with this notebook. It does an excellent job if you are not asking too much of it. However, if you need more horsepower, this might not be an ideal machine for you. \r\nHope this helps!"}, {"ProductId": 3, "time": "1 month ago", "rating": 4, "title": "Amazing Product!!", "content": "The MacBook Air computer is such a useful tool! This wonderful computer has been one of the most amazing blessings I have ever received because of the Software, Hardware, and because it promotes efficiency. The only downside to this product would be the price.\r\n The MacBook Air computer has a spectacular software system. It uses the Fifth Generation Intel Core i5 and i7 processors. This processor was designed to drain out less power, yet still allow a high level of performance for a longer amount of time. Along with the Intel Core processors, the SSD storage inside this computer provides a long battery life. The MacBook Air can get up to 12 hours of battery from a single charge. It can also be put into standby mode. This mode preserves up to 30 hours of battery life if the computer remains unused for three days. This device also has a variety of storage capacity options. The largest capacity offered is 512 GB and the lowest would be 128 GB. As a student, saving all of the documents needed for the rest of the semester is of great importance to me. With 128GB I am able to keep all of my personal photos, documents, and music on my MacBook Air. \r\n Not only is the software superb, but the hardware is too. On the Apple website, one descriptions that are listed says that this computer is \u201cThin. Light. Powerful. And ready for anything\u201d. For starters, its sleek design makes it a much easier task to travel with a computer. It is .68 inches thick and weighs almost three pounds. I find it extraordinarily easy to take out my computer during lectures for note taking, or during a flight to get homework done because of the \u201cthin\u201d and \u201clight\u201d design. Another part of this riveting computer that gets me every time is the backlit keyboard. The black keys with the ambient lighting under them provide a stunning appearance. Not to mention, it also allows the user to be able to see much better. My MacBook Air is one of the most aesthetically pleasing computers I have ever seen. The astonishingly thin, and lovely silver exterior creates such an angelic illusion. If you are someone who enjoys a stylish yet classy look then this is the right computer for you. \r\nSoftware and hardware are both important features in a computer; however, what do those things matter if the user does not feel efficient using it? The MacBook Air offers a ton of different applications that produce efficiency in your daily work. This computer has allowed me to do just about anything with the applications it possesses. Apps such as Pages, Keynote, Numbers, and IBooks form a part in what I do every day both in and outside of school. Another useful feature on this computer is Siri. Siri is a built-in assistant who is capacitated with doing everything to help in any way necessary. All of these features allow one to be efficient and get work done in a timely manner, with few to no errors or frustrations. Some people believe that this computer is too complicated to use but after a day or two of just playing around with my computer I was able to figure it out and it became a matter of second nature.\r\nThe only con to the MacBook Air would be the price. The price for this computer varies depending on things like the size, processing models, and storage capacity. Best Buy is currently selling this computer at $999.99 for 128GB of storage. If more storage space is needed, then the price goes up; however, Best Buy offers 12-month financing which would leave the buyer to pay about $83 a month. This pricing is only for the lowest storage capacity and the 13-inch display. I understand why the price is the way that it is because of all of the great features it possesses, however; it is unobtainable to many. If you don't mind the price go for it. This computer has changed the way I do everything for better and I believe it could do the same for you. \r\n My MacBook air is undeniably a necessary tool in my everyday life. It has changed the way do things on a daily basis. If you're looking for an excellent computer that has impressive software, hardware, and promotes efficiency, then consider this computer. It has earned our out of five stars on my behalf. It would have been five out of five if the price hadn\u2019t been so expensive."}, {"ProductId": 3, "time": "1 month ago", "rating": 5, "title": "Happy College Student", "content": "We purchased the MacBook for our son who was graduating high school and heading off to college.

I will tell you that the price on this computer is a hard pill to swallow, especially since chrome books can tend to run on the cheaper side.

Little did I know, when price matching, it has to be not only shipped from Amazon, it needed to be sold from them as well. After this new, I was crushed, it was a substantial difference. However, I knew what we were going in there to purchase this item, and couldn't leave empty handed. The sales man that helped us went over all the amazing features of the computer, he showed us the resolution, color and clarity of the screen, which were all amazing. He wasn't pushy at all, but made multiple suggestions based off his own experience. He highly recommended the apple care and all of it's features and price saving options! He even pointed out the cover that he had on his. While looking at covers and waiting for him to pull the computer out of the locked cage, we browsed around the store. All of the \"new\" high tech, just released computers didn't hold up to the MacBook. They were all lacking in at least one thing that made the MacBooks all over package. Upon returning, he informed us that he was able to find a price match the he was able to , We ended up paying even less then what we would have, had he been able to match the price I found, Our son was absolutely thrilled with the gift, and was barely able to get though the rest of the gift before taking it out of the box and starting it up!

Even though I love Apple products and wanted another one, I decided to save some cash and left with a Lenovo Yoga 720. I thought the features that it had were great and I thought I would give Windows a try. Needless to say, it didn't take long for me to realize how much I missed the simplicity of Mac OS. After four days, I couldn't take it any longer and I took my PC back to Best Buy and eventually left with this Macbook Air. I have to say that I am very pleased overall with this laptop. There really is no comparison when it comes to Apple and build quality vs any PC maker. The Lenovo was nice but it still felt cheap and plasticy, for lack of a better word. This laptop is fantastic, it has a great selection of ports, is lightening quick and has absolutely amazing battery life. All the while at an affordable price. However, the one thing I do have to complain about this laptop is its screen. Especially when comparing it to the screen of the Lenovo and many other PC's in this price range, it is pretty bad. However, Apple didn't do this by accident, the lower resolution screen is what gives this Laptop its amazing battery life. The screen isn't terrible, but if you are coming from a retina display or a high quality HD display, this screen may bug you at first. It definitely bothered me for the first few days but I have since accepted it and I love the battery life in this thing. So it kind of depends on what your needs are.

While the IOS takes up more room than it used to, it is less space than Windows and doesn\u2019t constantly update. Bought a cheap Dell that can no longer update Windows because of lack of room. The Air is older technology, as reviews point out, but my Apple products have always been very reliable and Apple stores are available and the staff is helpful. I have some familiarity with several systems and find Apple just more user friendly. It took longer to find something as basic as line spacing in Word, while Pages had it immediately visible. The Air may be a bit dated and lack a retina screen, but keeping it simple and quality control are worth something. Keyboard and track pad are still among the very best. Read the Air wil either be updated and cheaper or discontinued, but who knows.

The keyboard is lit so that helps with late night homework.\r\n- Easy to learn and navigate. Even with non-apple products. I downloaded word and it works great on this mac, as does PowerPoint.\r\n- Lightweight. This thing is so easy to carry. In my undergrad I had a traditional laptop, and it was so heavy to carry on campus. I have this one in a small sleeve and it is very easy to transport back and forth.\r\n- Quiet - this thing does not make a lot of noise when typing. The key stroke isn't as deep, so the click isn't as loud, which is nice when you're in class taking notes.\r\n- Excellent sound system - its speakers are clear and LOUD. Great for when you just have to have an impromptu dance party while making dinner with your kids :)\r\n- Good battery life - I use this thing daily, and have to charge it about once a week, maybe twice a week depending on how much late night surfing I'm doing.\r\n- Fast - it has great processing time. I'm constantly taking pictures on my phone and airdropping them to the MacBook Air (what can I say, my cloud is already full!). It takes literally seconds for this thing to download 35+ pictures.\r\n- it has a USB port still. The newer MacBook Pro does not, which would drive me nuts!\r\n\r\nCons\r\nI will say it can be a bit cumbersome to use the pad.

Here are my early impressions:It looks and feels better.  It is sleeker, and surprisingly lighter, smaller and well, just nicer to play with. Slimmer bezels and thinner case make this computer extremely portable. I was a bit hesitant to go with the gold color, but it looks great and the color is a bit darker than the rose gold IPhone that I have.It is faster.  It has a better processor and more memory.  Maybe for complex tasks the Pro might be better, but for everyday web browsing, video watching, music, email etc., the new Air is definitely an upgrade.The retina display is beautiful.  Not to take anything away from the 2013 model, which has an excellent display, but this is very nice.  It's not quite as bright as the older model, and I find myself adjusting it to the highest, or near highest level.  This is obviously affecting battery life, which seems good to me in any event.  But I don't think 12 hours is a reasonable expectation, unless the screen brightness is set pretty low.The keyboard is nicer and the speakers sound surprisingly good. Pretty amazing when you consider how thin this laptop is. You will notice more bass, and clear and louder sound. The touch ID is cool. It recognizes my fingerprint in a split second with no issues.On the negative side, it's expensive.  For the price, it should probably have more hard drive space.  And it's a somewhat ridiculous $200 to upgrade to 256 GB. I also kind of wish it had a regular USB port. Welcome to the future. It does have a regular phone jack though. That adapter you need for the newer IPhones always bugged me.One more thing I just remembered.  The viewing angles have been drastically improved.  On my old Air, you had to tilt the screen just right and place it directly in front of you.

I have a hard time making a commitment to my tech. I have high standards and always looking for the perfect blend of performance and design. I have tried the Surface Pro, Surface Laptop, XPS 13, HP Spectre x360, Asus Zenbook and MacBook Pro. My wife is beginning to worry about my inability to commit lol.Enter the 2017 MacBook 12 inch. At the same price as the MacBook Pro, it didn't make a lot of sense to buy something smaller with worse specs but I decided... what the heck... I'll give it a try.Upon opening the box I was in awe of the build quality and weight. It is unbelievably comfortable to use on your lap and carry around the house. The keyboard is a joy to use as well with its edge to edge build. I was worried the screen would be too small but it honestly looks great and have no issues. The battery is fantastic too!Heres the deal... I don't do anything too intense on this laptop. I don't game or do 4k video editing. I use multiple chrome tabs, MS Office products, Photoshop, Slack, Email and a few other things. This computer handles it all easily with no slowdowns.I also don't need an awkward 2 in 1... Every 2 in 1 I have tried it too heavy to comfortably use as a tablet and makes sacrifices as a laptop. Just buy a good laptop and a good tablet, its way better.The one port doesn't bother me all that much. Sure, it would be nice to have more but I don't use any accessories that need a port. Maybe I am in the minority here.So, who is this for? Well, people like me who want a productive machine that is also comfortable to use and portable. People who want a fast machine, fanless, excellent build quality that can handle a good amount of tabs and apps open at the same time. Yes, I do believe this should be closer to $999 and not $1299.

It still works fine to this day, but its finally starting to really show its age in speed and workflow. I have been waiting for an 8th gen Intel refresh on either the Macbook Pro or the Imac in order to finally upgrade. When they released the Macbook Pro's a few weeks ago I figured I would give the Macbook a shot. I've had a few days to kind of play around with it and here are my honest thoughts.\r\n\r\nIts a beautiful machine. This thing chews through anything I throw at it. I am primarily a photographer so Lightroom is the ultimate test for me and it passed with flying colors. I am very happy with the overall performance of the laptop, in short its a performance Beast. BUT..here's where the Macbook starts to become an issue for me. \r\n I like to plug my laptop into monitors when I'm working at home. And with apple's choice to go completely USB-C it causes alot of issues with my current setup. I have 2 27 inch monitors, an older Cinema Display and a Thunderbolt Display. The Cinema won't connect because its not thunderbolt 2 and the Thunderbolt does not look good for some reason. The thunderbolt display also cant charge the Macbook itself requiring the cable and the monitor to eat up 2 of the 4 USB-C ports. Forcing me to maybe consider looking into a new monitor, but apple doesn't make them anymore so I have to look to an LG or replacement brand. There's no Audio Jack cable so I can't plug the computer into my desktop speakers. And I literally have had to buy an adapter for everything, I had to buy an Adapter just to be able to use my Anker 10USB Adapter. It's very odd to me that Apple would choose to get rid of such basic things. No SD Card reader either. These are very small and minuscule things that probably could have still remained in the design of the computer. It's even basic things like not even being able to connect a USB mouse to the laptop without an adapter. \r\n\r\nI know that these problems are probably nothing new or surprising to people that reviewed or have had the touch bar USB-C models for me, but its really crazy to me that Apple made this decision. I see no real benefit to them doing this and it makes the computer alot less functional. I am going to see if I can get a decent monitor setup going otherwise I may have to consider returning this and waiting for the Imac 8th gen refresh to hopefully happen later this year. At least that model will have an SD card reader and an Audio jack lol."}, {"ProductId": 10, "time": "3 months ago", "rating": 5, "title": "Best MacBook I have ever owned", "content": "Where do I start with this review.

I have about 30 years of IT management experience so I like to at least think that I know about what I am talking about. :)\r\n\r\nNow, here is the reality of this machine. This is the best laptop I have ever owned, Mac, or PC, ever, PERIOD. It isn't even close. Yes, there are windows laptops that are less expensive. Yes, they have more power, yes they may have more ports, yes they may have 4k screens. To me, it doesn't matter. The ecosystem that Apple has built with the way their products work together, along with the style, power, and battery life of these machines makes them the ones to beat. \r\n\r\nNow the keyboard may look the same, but it really does feel different, and it is quieter. I don't know if it is going to hold up the test of time, but I am praying it does. I have AppleCare just in case. I would encourage everyone to get AppleCare as replacing the keyboard out of warranty will se you back about $400. People say that the Touch Bar is a gimmick, but I actually find it useful in some apps. I cannot say how nice it is to have a 16:10 format screen still in 2018, but it is. The machine is silent unless under load, and runs cool unless very stressed. If you are a Adobe Premier user, then I would buy a Windows machine, but if you are a Final Cut user, or may be, then this is the machine for you to edit with. It is crazy fast thanks to the optimization of FCP and the speed of the SSD. 3GB a second speeds on the SSD is just disgusting. Really disgusting. I still think the trackpad is oversized for no logical reason (wish I could use an Apple Pencil with it) and I am ready for Mojave other than that this machine is perfect to me. Again to ME. I don't care about having to use dongles. I don't mind the 720p camera, so to me this is just the best laptop on the market today. \r\n\r\nWhat would make it perfect? A little more keyboard travel. An Nvidia card instead of the AMD. 1080P Webcamera. An SD card reader built in.

There\u2019s really not much, from a hardware perspective, to complain about in how this machine is built.\r\n\r\nThat said... since 2016 and Apple\u2019s move to only Thunderbolt 3 ports, getting this machine into my professional workflow has been nothing short of a compromise. New cables were needed to connect my two 4K displays (could have got adapters but the cables are less unsightly, even then... would still need the adapters), one port is used to charge, leaving me only with a single port to plug in USB or Thunderbolt drives, SD Card readers, Ethernet adapters, etc. To make full use of my equipment I needed a external dock to accommodate those things, so that\u2019s even more money on top of things. Still wish they would make it about 1/8\u201d thicker and just give us two RAM slots and access to the SSD but that may be asking too much of the current day Apple design team.\r\n\r\nIf your setup is less complex, or your IO needs aren\u2019t as stringent, you will be fine.

How it saves space by collapsing and making room for more buttons. Support it in applications like Final Cut, Email, Calendar, etc. can be helpful for shortcuts. Good idea.\r\n2. Keyboard. I don't think it's as bad as reported.\r\n3. Size. Not too heavy. It's thin.\r\n4. Screen. Bright and clear. A nice size.\r\n5. Performance. Ever since Apple did the processor update, it's performed well and it's definitely an upgrade over my 2012 machine.\r\n6. Ports. It's nice to have ports that allow you to use your power or plug in devices on any side and any location on the laptop. Could reduce amount of damaged cables due to stress and bending especially when your power cord is plugged in to an outlet on the opposite side.\r\n7. Battery Life. Lasts a good long time even when doing Final Cut and Motion projects.\r\n8. Operating System. It's really makes using the machine a good experience.\r\nHere's what could use improvement:\r\n1. Touch Bar. For some things, it doesn't make sense to pull your hands from typing position to reach up to the bar. Maybe making a bar just above the trackpad somehow?\r\n2. Ports. Have to buy all new adapters and cables. No SD Card slot although a multi-purpose dock is a great solution...maybe even better than putting multiple ports on the laptop.

The keyboard feels slightly better with a little more spring and it is not as loud and and clicky as last years model. There is a small membrane under the keys that should eliminate the keys having issues. The speakers are now louder and fuller then last years model. The battery is also a little bit bigger to compensate for the higher processing power. You can now talk to Siri but just talking with a new chip that is being used. The SSD is also faster.

I have used it extensively for about a month and here are the Pros and Cons.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n-Drop dead gorgeous screen, Retina cannot be beaten\r\n-Fast, the Core i5 CPU has no trouble keeping up\r\n-Good battery life, I generally can go 8-10 hours of hard use between charges\r\n-Wakes up quickly, just as fast as your iPhone or iPad\r\n-OSX has grown on me, its very intuitive once you get the hang of it\r\n-Oversized trackpad is cool, as is the haptic feedback you get when you press it\r\n-Laptop is very high quality, the aluminum feels and looks great, nothing feels cheap\r\n-Speakers are the best you can get on a laptop, plenty of volume and depth and even some bass\r\n-Not too heavy, it was in my backpack for a recent trip I took and it was fine as far as weight\r\n-Most content I used on my iPad is available on the Mac, including Zinio, iTunes movies and shows and Outlook app\r\n-Getting and sending text messages and making and receiving telephone calls on the MacBook is very handy, works so long as the iPhone is nearby \r\n-Did I mention the gorgeous Retina screen?\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n-Keyboard travel is very short, it takes some time to get used to it\r\n-No Netflix app for Mac - whats up with that, they have an app for Windows 10\r\n-Power supply is big and buying a second one for your backpack for trips is expensive\r\n-Limited connectivity options, this model only has two Thunderbolt USB-C ports and a headphone jack\r\n-More powerful models can get pricey"}, {"ProductId": 11, "time": "2 months ago", "rating": 5, "title": "Perfect laptop for on-the-go ANYTHING!!", "content": "I have always been an apple fan for a long time, i have waited for 6yrs to get my hands on a macbook pro, at first i was very skeptical, i built a custom PC to act as a \"game rig\", and it turned out amazing, price was double but totally worth it! It handled everything i through at it games, word processing for my side business at the time, editing of my pics and videos off my go pro, and it was lightning fast Core i7 extreme liquid cooled, 2TB HDD raid, 32gb of DDR4 Ram, Nvidia GTX 1080TI, 256GB SSD (for OS), ASUS R.O.G Maximus MotherBoard, 42in 4k LG curved monitor. Windows OS 10, Again i built this computer for a purpose to play games!!, I was thinking of going with a mobile (gaming PC) i.e. Asus, MSI, Alienware, but realized they were so big and bulky, picture like caring around a desktop everywhere you go, i sat down and thought to myself what is going to be the soul purpose of my laptop, to play games?.....Well no i built my desktop for that....word processing?...Yea every computer and tablet can do that now days....criuse the web?....well yea my tablet and phone are good enough for that....then i figured it out....i wanted something to handle a little of everything!....but not extreme...lightweight for ease of travel to and from class/work then i saw this macbook sitting there for display at my local bestbuy, i now thought wow price is doubled of a PC, Lightweight, powerful duel core i5 Processor Duo's are more stable for everyday use in my professional opinion, Quad cores are pointless, after a test you will see that quad cores don't even hit all the cores, at full load they will but at basic use they will only use 2, and some of the 8th gen duo's, have faster speeds with the boost feature then the i5 quads!, All-in-all i decided to go with my mac 13in i5 after seeing the beautiful display, ultra portable design, really bright backlight keyboard, and amazing touchpad!, for the price point of this small but powerful machine, very much worth it!, i will be using it for online schooling, picture and video editing with my go pro, and help with my new job. Don't let the HDD size trick you!!! Buy a portable HDD for mass storage and use google drive for everything else!! Computers don't NEED hdd space to function!!

Prior to this I spent a lifetime on Windows and Linux computers. Those who raise the question of price (I did as well) should look at all the indicators, licensing renewals, longevity, resale value, etc.\r\n\r\nHere's what I can offer. \r\n\r\n- They keys are lower profile than my Dell Precision M3800 which threw me off at first, but now that I've put in about 40 hours of time, I'm typing faster and with less movement.\r\n\r\n- The batter lasts a long time. If I charge it fully and show up at the office at 8AM, I won't even think about charging it all day. I still bring my adapter every morning to work but I never take it out of my bag. I expect that from my Chromebook, but from a laptop with such a nice display, with rich colors, contrast and resolution, yea... I'm very impressed. I've been typing on this thing for the last 4 hours non-stop and it's currently at 88% capacity.\r\n\r\n- Updates! I already got the latest version of Mac's operating system that was released. Something I didn't realize, upgrades are included. If they come out with a new version of MacOS, I just install it, I don't have to buy it again. If I want to upgrade my Dell, I'd have to pay at least $100 for Windows 10.\r\n\r\n- The touchpad is not a button at all. It's just a flat piece of glass, but as soon as you turn it on, it acts as though it is a button. The main benefit is that there are no 'dead zones' on the pad. No matter where you press, it gives your fingers the same response.\r\n\r\n- The operating system is paired really well with iPhones. I keep finding more and more integration between my phone and MacBook, and in the most sensible places.\r\n\r\n- Macs include \"Boot Camp\", a program that will walk you through installing Microsoft Windows 10 right along side Mac's OSX. I did that right away just to see how it would go. It was flawless and windows ran rather nicely on the Mac. So now I have the best of both worlds, mainly using Windows for games like Lego Worlds.\r\n\r\n- The sound system is solid. Lots of bass, clarity, and full volume without vibrations or buzzing. I don't use my speakers much, but it cuts through the room when you're trying to listen to something in a noisy environment.\r\n\r\n- The webcam is solid as well.\r\n\r\nI was expecting a much taller walled garden, but what I see is a really good marriage of hardware and software, something that I think any company would want if they could pull it off.\r\n\r\nWhen I turn my MacBook off I miss it already. Maybe it's the Apple logo, or it's wonderful display, intuitive applications and features. I honestly don't know, but something about this MacBook just makes me really happy and no regret.

It wasn't a bad performing machine, but I wasn't sure the value was there, and I say that as someone with 10 Apple devices attached to my id. I'm no stranger to the Apple tax, but I just didn't feel this computer was as deserving. Its also important to note that I purchased this laptop when it was on sale for $1049. Above this price and it gets even harder to justify. The truth is, however, what choice do you have if you want a MacBook these days? The MacBook Air is priced lower, but is an aged design dogged mostly by its pitiful screen. The MacBook pros with touch bars are wildly more expensive for their gimmick feature that has been a quantitative failure. These more expensive models also needle$$ly hold the extra ports and higher clock speeds hostage from the non Touch Bar models. I'm a touch typing software developer, I like having the row of physical function keys. There's also the 'Macbook' but its generally the same price for vastly less CPU power in exchange for high base storage space. I really considered that model but the 'Pro' was on sale at the time, 128GB is in my opinion ridiculous for a 'Pro' computer. I'm getting by on it, but this laptop is, for me, not my primary machine, I use it on the go, and then work mostly on an iMac at home. I dunno, its just not a great time for apple laptops at the moment. The USB-C revolution hasn't arrived yet. None of the iPhones can even connect to a MacBook without a separate cable purchase. The pricing seems high, even for Apple. The MacBook lineup is central in an unexpectedly, currently, disjointed ecosystem for Apple. \r\nI'm going to say 'Yes' to the recommend to a friend question, but the truth is it would seriously depend. I think most non-power users would be better served by the 'MacBook'. I think that the Air is past its time and the Touch Bar models are a gimmick, and if this is your only computer don't even bother with the 128GB model."}, {"ProductId": 11, "time": "8 months ago", "rating": 5, "title": "Best 13 inch MacBook \u201cPro\u201d ever!", "content": "This review is really intriguing to me because this MacBook \u201cPro\u201d is amazing for me and people like me that have a desk job like I have.\r\nI put the PRO in Quotation marks not because it is not a pro machine; but because pro has been confiscated by many to mean video/photo editing at 5K and 7K raw files. I call this mac a pro computer because professional means so much more than that.\r\n\r\nThis computer is pro partly due to the fact that when combined with the rest of the Apple ecosystem everything from sending/sharing files to having all of your contacts and Apple products just work without fuss. Now, I know that the hero there is the software not the hardware; however, when combined, this computer can not be beat.\r\nWhen it comes to the hardware, the screen is gorgeous, the weight is perfect and the aluminum construction is top notch; but to mention that the keyboard is a pleasure to type on. Why does this matter to me; well it matters because my job requires a great deal of typing and interacting with docs of all kinds. The typing experience on this computer is simply amazing and puts it over the 12 inch MacBook in my opinion. This is where software and hardware come together to form something special.\r\nI have the base model which is up to the task with everything I have thrown at it so far. Everything even includes the one time I had to edit a 4K video at 60 fps.\r\n\r\nThe major issue people point to with this computer is the inclusion of only 2 USB-C ports. I for one have not had to live the dongle life as almost everything I do happens with iCloud. Once the doc is saved on my computer, it is automatically saved to all of my other Apple products!\r\n\r\nI did purchase a USB-C docking station that has all types of ports in the back and connects my laptop to a 4K display, all with just one cable! \r\nIn other words, I never find myself needing an SD card, Ethernet connection, USB port or Video Out port while out on the road. I only need those things while in the office and the docking station works great for that.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion this is the best MacBook Pro for office professionals!

Especially individuals who currently already own other Apple products such as an I-Phone or I-Pad. It has everyday features like access to the internet, apps, games, I tunes, I movie, etc. While also having more advance features for school, or even a professional career. Such as, being compatible with Microsoft programs like excel, power point, and word.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvaluation Criteria: Over the years I have used a number of different computers including both PC\u2019s, and MacBook\u2019s. I have learned that the key features to make a computer stand out are the display, processor, storage, and design. \r\n\r\n\r\nPros: The MacBook Pro has many unique aspects that separate it from other computers on the market. The 2017 MacBook pro is equipped with a 256 GB SSD which allows plentiful space to store my projects, music, movies, games, and photos. Also, the computer has one of the fastest processors on the market saving those precious seconds on a busy school day. The most unique feature on the MacBook Pro is its sleek sophisticated design. The computer is very thin and light; while also, feeling sturdy. In fact, it is so light sometimes when I\u2019m walking to class I actually get worried I forgot my laptop at home.\r\n\r\n\r\nCons: The biggest road block I faced in my decision to purchase a new MacBook pro was the price. There are many other cheaper alternatives on the market. Although these cheaper versions of the product don\u2019t offer the same features, compatibility, and sleekness of a 2017 MacBook Pro. In order for the mac book to get the elegant updated 2017 design, the designers decided to not add a disk drive to the product. One other annoying factor is that the New Mac Book is not compatible with Apples new headphones. Which have been out since November 2016, when the I-Phone 7 released. \r\n\r\n\r\nOverall: I Think the MacBook Pro is a well built, and well-designed product that really sticks out from the competition. I would 10/10 recommend anyone whom already owns an apple phone, too also purchase the MacBook Pro. The compatibility between the devices will help day to day life be more organized. The reason I gave the product only four stars was the issue with the headphone jack. One of the biggest pros of the owning a MacBook is the compatibility with the I-phone. In the future, I would hope to see them add another headphone jack that can be used with the apple headphones."}, {"ProductId": 11, "time": "1 year ago", "rating": 3, "title": "I think I hate it", "content": "I've used MacBooks for a little over a decade. This is the 4th I've owned, and my least favorite so far.\r\n\r\nWhat I love:\r\nI use my Pro primarily for photo processing. I love the retina display, reliability, processing power, and battery life. It's why I own a MacBook Pro. Specific to this version, I love that the speakers are now on right on top, and that the new charger does not use magnets. However, I don't want to give Apple a lot of credit for simply fixing their own bad designs.\r\n\r\nWhat I find annoying:\r\nThis pro has two USB-C ports and a an aux port. That's it. No USB ports, no SD card, no DisplayPort or Thunderbolt Port. I thought I could live with it, but it's absolutely aggravating. I need a $30 adaptor to pull images off my SD card, another $30 adaptor to transfer them to my external hard drive, and once those two are plugged in, I'm out of ports. I can't even charge my computer while transferring images but that uses one of the USB-C ports. \r\n\r\nWhat I hate:\r\nThe keyboard and trackpad. You use them for everything you do - and I hate them. The keys are difficult to press, too big, too flat, too close together - something. I can't tell you exactly what it is about them, but I hate them. And I hate the noise they make. Similarly, I hate the trackpad. I can't tell you what it is specifically about the Force Touch trackpad that makes me hate it so much, but I absolutely do hate it.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I don't care if the machine is beautiful or powerful, it is almost too annoying to use, and that makes it fairly useless to me."}, {"ProductId": 11, "time": "1 year ago", "rating": 5, "title": "Long Time Windows User", "content": "In a nutshell. the best premium laptops on the market currently are this and the Microsoft Surface laptop (although long reliability is still questionable as of yet for the Surface laptop), with that said, I leaning towards the Surface since I'm more familiar with Windows but based on research that showed how easy it is to convert to OS X (Apple Migrant Software) and Windows software like Google Drive, OneDrive and Office 365 works perfect on a Mac.

Good CPU & 8GB-RAM is very powerful for a laptop used for work.\r\n2. SSD means super fast loading time.

Retina display gives a very good resolution for a 13 inch screen.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n1. 13 inch is kind of small. Although Retina gives you a good resolution, the small font size is not ideal if you want to protect your eyesight. (I'm planning to get a secondary monitor; will update then)\r\n2. There are only 2 USB-C ports, and you need to buy adapters for USB/HDMI or other kinds of ports. I bought a multiport adapter which costed $69. (see pic)\r\n3. The bottom of the laptop is completely sealed, and there are only two small air outlets on the far side (see pic). The laptop got really hot during my test run with Stellaris.

I have compared other laptops and a comparison I have made is, how clean and smooth the images are displayed. It comes in two different sizes and colors, such as the 13 inch or the 15 inch laptop coming in either space gray or silver. It also comes with different storage options, the 13 inch MacBook Pro comes in a 128GB or 256GB based storage, this is especially used for someone who would store a lot of information on their laptop. There are several options you can opt for, depending on your desired needs. \r\n\r\nI opted for the 13 inch with 128GB based storage in space gray MacBook Pro. I needed to invest in a laptop that would be useful for college and once I am out of college. It is super lightweight and can be carried around about anywhere. Another feature, is the stereo speakers, I love listening to music with high volumes so this was great when I heard the potential of the MacBook Pro. If you use your laptop and you are concerned about the battery life, it will definitely last you a good while, it lasts up to 10 hours of wireless web. This is especially great if you travel or use it a lot for work. \r\n\r\nAlthough, the MacBook Pro is a newer product that recently was released, it presents this downfall such as the affordability of the product. There are some other models more affordable that you would like to consider due to the price. \r\n\r\nMacBook Pro would be beneficial if you are looking at investing in a high quality laptop that will last you a good while.

Unfortunately, the update in technology has taken a toll on the Macbook Pro and it had also been beaten up a bit on my end. I finally decided to upgrade and with Best Buy offering gift cards for the trade in of your old laptop, it was a no brainer at that point. Not to mention the geek squad support that is included. This computer is BEAUTIFUL! I didn't spring for the most expensive one because I do not need all of the storage, but I honestly can't even tell. The 13\" screen seems bigger to be honest and when I play music just from the laptop it sounds phenomenal, not like a party kind of speaker, but for a couple of people out on the back patio, it does well. I have made the normal business documents, to facetime with family, to even play a couple of games and it does it all so flawlessly! I will say if an extra long battery life is your main thing and you are always on the go then I would tell you to go with the Macbook Air. The Pro does have a good battery life but if you are running any kind of demanding application I wouldn't count it lasting longer than a couple of hours. I recommend that you buy the USB-C to USB adapter because it only has the ports for the USB-C so if you have any devices that you used with any previous generation computer then chances are it was the normal USB connection and you will need to get an adapter. The macbook pro seems super light to me and very portable, but I would recommend some kind of case, because even though it is so pretty without one, it can be very prone to scratches. All in all, not disappointed at all and worth every penny! Oh and buy Applecare, I used to work at an electronics store and I saw way too many customers coming in after they broke their apple device and they didn't get applecare and the repairs always cost so much money when if they had only had applecare it would have been so easy and cheap!

I am delighted with my Macbook pro. Productivity is much improved, even over my 3 monitor PC setup. I Grant you that some of that productivity is due to having a faster machine to work on, but a large part is the desktop switching inherent to Mac OSX, and not having to pick up my phone ever few minutes to answer a text (since they show up on my Mac). Brilliant. There is no way around it... There are things you just can't do on a Mac they way you do on a PC.

On top of that this Macbook Pro also a keyboard issue, after a few months of use, dust gets under the keys and makes it very difficult to use those keys (and can even break them permanently). On top of that you get thermal issues, sure the laptop is very quiet, but you trade silence for terrible performance. When doing anything intensive (editing photos or videos) the laptop will get up to 93C and the clock speeds will slow down. This increases the time it takes for a video to render and makes tasks like photo and video editing really slow. This could have been prevented if Apple used better thermal paste and made the computer louder.

In the end, the larger screen and better processor won me over. \r\n\r\nOne concern was that the keyboard would be horrible. After a little more than a week of use, I've adapted. It's not a great keyboard. I'm still getting used to the up/down arrow keys being positioned differently than on the MacBook Air. The short-travel keys are not as comfortable to type on for long periods of time, and it's resulted in my missing a few letters every now and then. But I'm gradually getting faster and more consistent on it. It just sucks that the user has to adapt to it instead of it being designed to better facilitate the user.\r\n\r\nAnother concern was battery life. The MacBook and MacBook Pro are both officially rated at 10 hours of battery life, but from what I read, I was concerned the MacBook Pro would have trouble actually achieving that. Using Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to do general media consumption and basic tasks, I'm seeing about 6-9 hours of battery life depending on load.

As a full-time student and someone who enjoys entertainment and gaming, Microsoft has been the way to go in terms of pricing. \r\n\r\nHonestly, you need to pick what you value... Microsoft and Apple both have their strengths and weaknesses.

I was so wrong once I started using my new MacBook Pro. I never realized how slow those had become. When opening applications, they are just there. It\u2019s simply amazing. Recently I went through my old 13\u201d laptop to clean things up so it could be used for another purpose, it was so slow and took so long, I could not go back. At first I thought the 15\u201d MacBook Pro would be too large since my other was a 13\u201d. I love it and wonder why I didn\u2019t do this the first time.\r\n\r\nBesides running my normal programs I beta test software and one item in particular used to take an hour plus to perform. Now it takes four minutes. I\u2019ve also noticed remote access with my iMac is absolutely flawless and just works every time, something my older laptop simply would not do.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve heard users complain about the Touch Bar and accidentally hitting it but if you are used to typing, that is not a problem. Originally I was not going to get the Touch Bar, but after using it, I like it and am getting more used to it. Eventually I\u2019ll customize it for various needs. The best part is being able to use Touch ID to log in, instead of my passcode. That and being able to use Siri to open folders, etc. for me as opposed to clicking. It\u2019s so much faster and can be accomplished with \u201cHey Siri\u201d , click the menu bar, the Siri app, or my preference, from the Touch Bar.\r\n\r\nIn beta testing the only unexpected caveat was due to Apple\u2019s new APFS file structure. It does not allow for third party file recovery or booting from external hard drives. Booting into Recovery Mode will allow you to designate an external hard drive as start up but it\u2019s no longer a simple matter of holding down the option key. As for file recovery, that\u2019s never been a concern of mine since I constantly maintain two different backups, one is Time Machine the other a clone. This is something I\u2019ve done since my first HD20 became corrupt years ago and my dealer said he could repair it. He did, by erasing the entire drive. \r\n\r\nIf it hadn\u2019t been for my wife secretly getting this for me, I would have procrastinated longer.

However, that's where the pros stop. The Macbook Pro's have been known to have keyboards that break very easily (once dust gets inside of the keys, they'll stop working) and the computer thermal throttles as soon as you use heavy programs such as Final Cut Pro or Adobe Photoshop. On top of that, this laptop really isn't practical unless you have a whole bunch of dongles lying around. There are only two USB C ports on the device and one is used just for charging. I'd say that unless you really need to use Final Cut Pro (DaVinci Resolve or Adobe Premiere is better) or you love iMessage, you'd be much better off buying a gaming laptop from MSI or Gigabyte. If you really need something lightweight however, you'd be much better off buying the Dell XPS 13. Or if you're really wanting to get a Macbook, buy yourself an older used Macbook Pro from 2015 or earlier.

I would recommend this over any other laptop out right now but get more space up front! \r\n\r\nOn to the good stuff \r\n\r\n-performance - I decided to get the base Touch Bar model that just came out because I wanted to see if the 8GB of ram plus those new processors would do what I needed it to do. I just have to say it hasn't let me down yet and I was surprised, I use this for video editing and photo editing, along with other graphics art projects and even with many things open it does very well and only gets a little warm when exporting video. I use this thing all the time and the one thing I wish is more hard drive space I haven't even noticed it being slow at all with the lower specs and thats saying something because I normally get the 15\" MacBook Pro's but when going from 2015 model I never felt the need to upgrade till this year and the time is right specs wise.\r\n\r\n- build quality - So I really enjoy the size and quality of this laptop and I know there have been all sorts of things negative about the new MacBooks but I really like this new keyboard and its a dream to type on ( for me at least go test one in store for your self ) this is a big improvement if you ask me over last year. then the chassis and screen all seem to be nice sturdy and great build quality I have not found another laptop that I feel has this same quality build wise.\r\n\r\n- size - Ok I know everyone wants small and smaller but I think that if these things got any smaller for my pro machine I wouldn't want it. This thing will fit anywhere and having the 13\" with this much power is great and I can use it places I never would before. \r\n\r\n-screen - Im not that big into no bezels like everyone else I would prefer sturdy non breaking screen over a full display any day. But this is on par with what you expect from apple it works and looks beautiful along with the new color match stuff built in to color correct in different lighting ( I turn this off for photo and video editing ). Also this doesn't just flip down on me when I move around and it doesn't have a ton of shake that you see in a lot of small form factor laptops, again this part feels sturdy.\r\n\r\n- Touch Bar - I love the computer but this I could live with or with out it ... I mean it does provide use and can make selecting things faster and I don't really like touch screen laptops so this is a good alternative. But you would have to make your self learn to use it and sometimes it might be easier to move the mouse sometimes its better to leave your hands and select on the Touch Bar ( but I would like the buttons back they moved like esc, just incase ) \r\n\r\n- Mouse - I see some saying its to big and takes up to much space but this is the only laptop I have found I like to work with out an external mouse and it feels weird to me when you go to other computers in the house and their mouse is so tiny and can't move screen edge to edge. Then I have not had any problems hitting it while I type and I even made it a point to keep my palms down when I type and still nothing, check that for your self because it could be different with different people. But this part makes working easier and feels very nice to use and touch.\r\n\r\n- ports - Just have to say it but the ports could at times slow you down a little but I really haven't noticed any differences and I just buy things for the USB C and they work and they are fast. Hasn't been a problem and if you need the device for the power and can afford it I would say get it and grab a few USB C things like SD reader and a few adapters till you get swapped out or just incase and you will be just fine! One little thing when doing things with this SSD and USB C storage things move around pretty quick like photo files ( maybe its a good thing but I would have liked one USB or SD port lol ) \r\n\r\nOver all I am happy I waited till 2018 to upgrade my personal machine and I think this is the time to get a MacBook Pro because I think the look and hardware are better now than in the last few editions. I would recommend and do enjoy this laptop, I will be getting an external screen for home use and screen size and the external hard drive. Get more space up front and if you know you can't work on 13\" then spend a few more dollars and go bigger but for the size and price with the options now to get eGPU and hook up and external monitor this is the perfect travel size and power to boot."}, {"ProductId": 14, "time": "4 months ago", "rating": 5, "title": "A Solid MacBook Upgrade", "content": "Pros:\r\n-Beautiful Display\r\n-Blazing Fast\r\n-Thin, Sleek and Lightweight\r\n-Pretty Good Battery Life\r\n-Improved Sound Quality\r\n-Fingerprint Sensor \r\nCons:\r\n-Only Thunderbolt Ports... Really?\r\n-Gets Hot\r\n-Touch Bar Isn't Necessary\r\n-Magnetic Charger is gone\r\n\r\nI just replaced my old 2012 MacBook Pro 13\" after its motherboard finally gave out, and knew this would be the model I'd replace it with, when the time came. Overall, I'd highly recommend this computer to anyone! It can handle fairly sizeable workloads, is great at multitasking, and has more than enough processing power to handle anything you throw at it. It has 8GB of RAM, an Intel i5 quad core processor, and a 256 GB solid state drive (in short, much faster at storage and more energy efficient). The display is beautiful! The Retina Display does not disappoint, as it has a 1600p display, and is excellent for reading material or for inspecting things without artifacts on the edges of letters or objects. The colors are vivid and crisp, the display gets bright, and has fairly deep black levels and pretty good contrast. When you buy a laptop for $1800, these things are mandatory, and Apple understands that. I've put it through a day of use and found that the battery life is good. It's not great, but it's good enough to get you though a day of moderate use (~10 to 12 hours), so Apple's claim seems to hold up. The sound quality is a step up, as well. It's not mind blowing, but it's better than my MacBook's speakers from six model years ago. The fingerprint reader is also a nice touch. It's just another layer of added security, which is something I will never complain about, and can't imagine most people would complain about that, either.\r\n\r\nAs for the cons, by far the biggest is the Thunderbolt port only setup. Really, Apple? I know they're trying to get ahead of the game, but not even a freaking adapter for USB or HDMI? I'm paying $1800 for a laptop, and I don't think throwing a $20 adapter in is asking for too much. The second thing is it also gets pretty hot while sitting on your lap. I would definitely recommend sitting your MacBook on a flat surface with plenty of space on the bottom for ventilation. The Touch Bar, while a cool feature, seems a little gimmicky and unnecessary, but I also assume they have some cool uses coming for it in the near future. If you got the MacBook version without the Touch Bar, you won't be missing out on much, if anything. The last one is a bit of a nitpick, but I really miss the magnetic charging cable the older MacBooks had. For hardware and space reasons they had to do away with it on this one, but it was a really nice feature that I would've liked to have had.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there's a lot more to love about this laptop than there is to dislike. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a solid, powerful laptop built to last!"}, {"ProductId": 14, "time": "1 month ago", "rating": 5, "title": "Love my MacBooks!!", "content": "I needed a new MacBook Pro and bought essentially the same model as I had. The only difference is that it is updated with a touch bar and different keyboard. I use all Apple products---iphone, iPad and MacBook and love that they all link together and I can see the same things on each product. The first one I bought I returned because the space bar was sticking and when I tried to update the system, it crashed. I had 14 days to exchange it, and on day 12 I just had this gut feeling something was wrong, and I exchanged it for the same model. Now that I have the new one, I know for a fact that there was something wrong with the other one just based on the way it \"acted\". This keyboard actually feels different than the original one. The only thing that makes me mad (and it is a pretty big thing, but Apple does this stuff ALL.THE.TIME) is that there are no USB ports. There are 4 \"C\" ports (which they claim all electronics are going to be switching to---we shall see what happens with that) so if you have anything you want to use with the laptop, you have to get an adapter that has USB ports. Since I use 2 Bluetooth mice, one at work & one at home, I needed an adapter with at least 2 USB ports. Apple makes an adapter that has one USB port for about $25. I found one online at B&H Photo that has 4 USB ports & one additional \"C\" port for the same price as the Apple adapter that only has one USB port. I ordered it & had it within 2 days. But---and this is what makes me laugh--there is a jack for a wired set of headphones/earbuds. When the iPhone 7 came out, I remember everybody going crazy because it didn't have a jack for the wired earbuds & we all had to either buy an adapter (I can't imagine how much money Apple makes from the adapters) or a set of Bluetooth earbuds/headphones. But a 2018 MacBook Pro has a jack for a set of wired earbuds? The one thing that I noticed is the battery life is no where near as good as my old MacBook Pro. Apple claims this is because the battery is smaller to make the unit lighter. If I use any bluetooth accessories, like my mouse or earbuds, the battery life is significantly affected. It charges very quickly though. But, the point of having a laptop is to be able to take it with you with a fully charged battery and get enough hours when you're out & about before you have to charge it again. The charging cord is no where near as long as the cord for my old one---and again, the charging cord for this new MacBook has that \"C\" port, so I can't even use my old c charging cord, and that sucks because I loved that charger. It was a magnetic connection, so all I had to do was get it close to the port & it would magnetically connect with a \"click\" so I knew it was properly attached. There was a little light on it too, which would be red when it needed a charge and it would turn to green when it was fully charged, which was really nice. The charging cord for this new MacBook doesn't have that---it makes a little tone when the cord is plugged into the \"C\" port, but that's it. I can see how the cable and/or \"C\" ports could get damaged by pushing the cord into the port. That's probably what Apple is hoping for. My 5 stars is more for the performance of the MacBook. And the customer service at Best Buy is great."}, {"ProductId": 14, "time": "4 months ago", "rating": 3, "title": "overheating???", "content": "So I had originally purchased the 2017 MacBook Pro 13\" with Touchbar earlier this week due to its sale price. However, after realizing it, the newer model was only $250 more. I figured for that little price difference it would be worth it to bump up to a faster performing machine. \r\n\r\nAfter getting home and doing some light configurations, (Downloading Office, listening to Apple Music, and surfing the web) I noticed that the chassis were a little warm on the sides. After further inspection i reached up to the touchbar and realized it was HOT. Not warm, but very hot. \r\n\r\nAfter discovering this I did some googling and discovered that this is a known issue that apple has not addressed yet. Apparently the computer is getting so warm that the CPU isnt even working at its fullest capabilities. In fact, its running SLOWER than the 2017 model?? \r\n\r\nI am a loyal Apple customer, this being my 3rd Mac in my lifetime. I admire the quality and reliability of their computers, so this is a very disappointing discovery. I hope Apple addresses the issue sooner rather than later. \r\n\r\nI gave it 3 starts because the computer itself is a great improvement since the last model in terms of screen, speakers and it is quite fast (when its not overheating). I plan on updating my review once there is a fix for this issue. But until then, its 3 starts from me. \r\n\r\nDo yourself a favor and hold off on the 2018 model until the issue is addressed.

I was so happy to get this new model due to that. The build quality is amazing. I love the huge trackpad. It\u2019s accuracy, smoothness, and gesture controls are unmatched by any other notebook computer. TouchID is my favorite part of the Touchbar as it makes logging in to the computer, websites/apps, and paying with ApplePay so easy and secure. Additionally, I\u2019m finding the Touchbar and it\u2019s customizations very useful too. Video scrubbing, audio scrubbing, and predictive options for moving email to different folders are great examples of its uncustomized uses. I\u2019ve already customized it to make other features easier for me like screenshots, opening new tabs, and moving YouTube videos into picture-in-picture mode when I\u2019m multitasking. The processor is fast and handles my browsing, emails, video watching, and light video editing well. I haven\u2019t done any heavy video editing yet, but I believe it will do a very good job with that as well. The absolute best part of any MacOS product, though, is how well it works with the ecosystem of other Apple products. Photos and videos I take on my iPhone XS are automatically available in my iCloud Photo Library for pulling into editing on my MacBook. No need to transfer anything with wires. I can pickup right where I left off with iMessages, email, phone calls, and other documents from the phone to the MacBook and back again. My airpods are super simple to switch audio sources.

The color is unbeatable.\r\n2.quiet. I used it to watch 4k movie. Although it is hot in touch bar area , fans are unexpected quiet. I was determined to buy the older and cheaper 2017 without bar model but doubted it will be noisy.\r\n3.more thunderbolts. You might think it is not that important cause two are enough, but the truth is you never know what devices you are going to connected.\r\n4.keyboard. I'm just the guy who hate typing in great force ,this is personal.\r\n\r\nDisadvantages\r\n1. sound. I don't know if it is the common issue or just my case. The sound is too sharp especially when I play human voice. Compared to my 2016 ipad pro, it sucks!!!\r\n2.touchbar. It is not only useless but also disturbing. Choosing word by touchbar makes me look like old people with bad eyesight. I have to convince myself that touchbar is designed to force users switching eyesight between the screen and the keyboard, so that they can protect their eyesight.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Apple still gives us an excellent choice using six years old appearance. The distance between apple and other winbook is smaller and smaller. Apple macbook fans hope it maintains its position in innovation, but from touchbar, I know there will be no changing your life macbook. This is the final formation of the mac and win books.

Though the memory and ram are the same, the newer model responds much quicker and processes much faster. I feel it is easier to type on the newer keyboard, though it took some time to adjust to. There is also a noticeable difference in the screen quality. I do not like the fact that there is no USB port. I know we are heading to a time where everything is cloud-based, but we are not there yet. Many people still use a USB port regularly and I find it ridiculous that I have to buy a $20 adapter to use one. As for the touch bar, it is very cool looking, but I have not found it of any use. Actually, I have accidentally tapped it with my pinky several times pressing the ESC key or activating Siri while I am trying to type a paper. I wish I saved $100 and went with the model without the touch bar. All in all, if you have an older model Mac and you want to upgrade it is kind of worth it.

That computer has provided excellent service for the past five years and still works well, but when I saw that Apple was offering $265 on a trade in, I decided to go for it. Here are my early impressions:It looks and feels better.  It is sleeker, and surprisingly lighter, smaller and well, just nicer to play with. Slimmer bezels and thinner case make this computer extremely portable. I was a bit hesitant to go with the gold color, but it looks great and the color is a bit darker than the rose gold IPhone that I have.It is faster.  It has a better processor and more memory.  Maybe for complex tasks the Pro might be better, but for everyday web browsing, video watching, music, email etc., the new Air is definitely an upgrade.The retina display is beautiful.  Not to take anything away from the 2013 model, which has an excellent display, but this is very nice.  It's not quite as bright as the older model, and I find myself adjusting it to the highest, or near highest level.  This is obviously affecting battery life, which seems good to me in any event.  But I don't think 12 hours is a reasonable expectation, unless the screen brightness is set pretty low.The keyboard is nicer and the speakers sound surprisingly good. Pretty amazing when you consider how thin this laptop is. You will notice more bass, and clear and louder sound. The touch ID is cool. It recognizes my fingerprint in a split second with no issues.On the negative side, it's expensive.  For the price, it should probably have more hard drive space.  And it's a somewhat ridiculous $200 to upgrade to 256 GB. I also kind of wish it had a regular USB port. Welcome to the future. It does have a regular phone jack though. That adapter you need for the newer IPhones always bugged me.One more thing I just remembered.  The viewing angles have been drastically improved.  On my old Air, you had to tilt the screen just right and place it directly in front of you.  Big difference here.Overall, this is a very beautiful laptop, and a great update if you are looking for something new.Read more", "ProductId": 16, "time": "November 11, 2018"}, {"rating": 5, "title": "Balanced Performanxe", "content": "This replaced a 2012 MBPr, which by apple standards had a year or 2 left before the OS upgrades stopped.

Ive noticed this is very snappy with all the mouse gestures, which have always been slow with my other laptop experiences (including the surface book gen 1). Screen is very bright and beautiful, keyboard is enjoyable to type on. The alcantara feels nice but now i fear eating around my laptop, but no stars docked for that because that will be on me if i dirty the keyboard. \r\nThe reason i gave this a 3 stars is for several reasons. First off, the previous surface laptop came with windows 10 pro, and now i have windows 10 home. for business use, this means that i have to pay extra money so i can use features such as remote desktop and hyper-v. The next reason is for keeping the mini display port. I know people are asking for usb-c, which i would love but all i care is for something more day-to-day, like a regular hdmi port. Now i have to buy an outdated adapter that i will only use for this device. \r\nApple is making an announcement on the 30th, If they come out something that blows this away i might jump ship. Meaning, if they have something for the same price with a better port selection (and better experience), why not buy a macbook and buy windows 10 pro ? I wasnt satisfied with the 2016 macbook pro, it was a little brick compared to this machine. And the fans kicked up allllll the time. So i'll probably have to play with the demo models when it comes out. \r\nOutside of the poor port selection and windows 10 downgrade, i am very satisfied with my experience and yes i do recommend this laptop.

Received it yesterday and found it to be more, much more, than I expected. The quality build is what you would expect from the surface line. The battery life could be better, but until the battery industry provides improved battery size, weight with performance, this is what we have to deal with for this size screen and quality with an intel chip. Most reviewers are bashing this thinking it should do what the surface pro does, how comical and disrespectful of their responsibility as professional tech authorities. My advice is to try it for yourself. Don't listen to the naysayers. This is an outstanding mobile device that has the ability to do on the go what you couldn't otherwise do with this size package. Are there improvements to be made, yes. But we didn't get the surface pro out the door before we had to deal with surface pro, 2,3, and 4...just saying :)Just a couple things on the other review.1. Upgrading to Windows Home from S mode was a breeze. Not sure what the other review was talking about, and it's free.2. Your going to have updates.

Or maybe you want a tablet that can be more than just that. I like the whole philosophy behind it, a device that you can take anywhere and use it in all your activities. After using it at work I can take the keyboard off and watch a movie or browse the web while listening some music or use a pen to do some digital painting as a hobby, It's just so versatile. I think this is the closest thing to what Microsoft wanted to achieve with the Surface line. Even closer than the already great Surface Pro.And there's this premium feel to it. The magnesium body feels very solid, the kickstand doesn't move if you don't want to and if you pair it with the Alcantara keyboard it's just a very different experience that you can feel. And yet it's so light. You'll have a disappointing experience touching a plastic laptop after using one of these.The downside is that it isn't precisely cheap. If you want it to be more than a tablet, you'll have to add the type cover keyboard, around $100 or more if you buy a Microsoft one (it's also great but I'm not reviewing it here). This just happens to be an affordable Surface product, and they're always expensive. But also so versatile and innovative that you'll find they worth it.It's also very sturdy. I found that out yesterday (there was a dog involved), it fell from a feet high right on the edge of the screen. I thought I would find a shattered or cracked display, but there was nothing on it. Not even on the edge, not a single dent or scratch on the whole thing, and it's working like if nothing happened (I'm using it to write this review).Most people complain about relatively short battery life but you can work for hours on it. I get it to work the whole day with the screen at its darkest and the battery saving mode on. Unless you use it outside that's enough brightness and performance for what you'll be using it. Another common complain are the thick bezels, but they're there for a reason, which becomes very obvious when you use it like a tablet.This might not be the device for you if what you want is high performance for CPU or graphic demanding tasks (and of course it's far from being a gamer PC) or if you really hate Windows. But if you're looking for a portable PC/tablet you can't go wrong with this. It's light, sturdy, completelly silent, has a sleek desing and offers a full desktop experience. And if you already own a Surface Pro you'll find this fascinating and even charming. It's a scaled down version of it.Read more", "ProductId": 26, "time": "September 16, 2018"}]}]}, "think pad": {"best_buy": [{"information": {"price": "$899.99", "id": 34}, "review": [{"ProductId": 34, "time": "3 months ago", "rating": 5, "title": "Outstanding Laptop That is Serviceable!", "content": "Thinkpad's are the best made and offer premium performance no other laptop comes close to. Before I bought this laptop, I bought a Dell XPS which only lasted 3 years and went through 2 service issues with Dell before the motherboard died. Then I bought an Acer Spin 5 which I used for about a year. The Acer Spin 5 is an outstanding mid-level laptop but it had trouble driving 3 monitors without the USB C port. I was also missing owning a well built solid laptop.\r\n\r\nI finally broke down and bought the Thinkpad L380 Yoga and LOVE IT! Before buying it, I wanted to make sure I could upgrade the memory and SSD and that the memory was not soldered to the board. I chatted with a tech on Lenovo's site and also confirmed this with the Lenovo rep in Best Buy. I was not going to buy it if I could not upgrade the memory. \r\n\r\nThis model is unique in the fact it has 2 memory slots and can take up to 32GB of memory. You can also remove the WIFI card and SSD to upgrade both. The entire unit is completely upgradeable and serviceable. I also have a Costco membership and could have bought the Lenovo Yoga X (top of the line model) but that unit's memory is soldered to the board. Also, it uses the newer type of SSD drive which is much more expensive. \r\n\r\nThe build quality and performance of this machine is OUTSTANDING! It's super fast and the screen and keyboard is amazing. I especially love the touch point for mouse control. Once you get used to a touch point, you will always hate using a track pad - trust me on this. \r\n\r\nAlso, this model has a world facing camera where you can take pictures from the front in tablet mode. It's a very unique model in the fact it's fully serviceable/upgradeable and has the world facing camera. \r\n\r\nI also love the fact the Lenovo software automatically downloads firmware, drivers and all available updates without having to go hunt them down yourself. The one thing I hate about the Acer Spin 5 I own is the fact they have no software to upgrade drivers and firmware. You have to go look for and load the firmware yourself from their website. Also, their drivers rarely ever get updated so I used a free driver update product called Driver Booster to keep it up to date. \r\n\r\nSeriously, don't waist your time and money buying a \"high end\" Dell XPS or consumer grade shiny metal HP Envy other high end consumer grade machine when you can get this laptop for $1000. There is no way you can go wrong with this unit. \r\n\r\nThe hardware is so well integrated that you can put this laptop up against a Dell with an I7 and this laptop will smoke it with it's I5 because the drivers are so well written and the hardware is so well integrated and tested. The specs don't matter if the hardware isn't properly designed to work together. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, it's better to get a well designed machine like a Think pad which may not have the I7 processor because it's going to perform much better and be much more stable under high stress performance situations. \r\n\r\nIt's also just great to use - the keyboard is so well built along with the touch point/track pad and solid materials used to built it. The thing I also don't like about my Acer Spin 5 is the cheapness of the materials. It really does make a big difference. \r\n\r\nHonestly, you can't go wrong with this laptop and once you own a Thinkpad, you can't go back. Just compare the Thinkpad Yoga to the regular Yoga quality next time you are in Best Buy and you will see what I am talking about."}, {"ProductId": 34, "time": "1 month ago", "rating": 1, "title": "Multiple problems - Very dissapointed", "content": "After doing a lot of research online, talking to several salesmen at Best Buy and at other stores this was supposed to be one of the more reliable and tougher PC's available when i purchased it when starting my business in March 2017. It was to be used mainly for running car tuning software (HP Tuners, Holley, Megasquirt EFI, etc), doing online bookwork and regular web surfing. It was a lot of money to spend that i had not anticipated but when my old Dell that i had forever finally died it was go cheap and hope it lasted or buy one i could rely on for years again. Out of the box the only issue i had was it wouldn't get a good connection to the net in a lot of places my old Dell would. That was easily fixed with an external wifi adapter i had to pack with me everywhere otherwise the performance was good, i was happy with it for the rest of a year.\r\nAt 13 months the speakers quit working so to hear anything i had to plug in HDMI or head phones, after maybe 20 plugins to the HDMI port it went south and would show a pink picture on the tv screen with no sound, i packed earphones now with WIFI adapter. I've owned it 17 months now, last night it worked and this morning it was dead. Totally. Won't turn on at all. First i bought a $65 charger, then searched google and found a video on how a tech shop was fixing the issue so i disassembled it, disconnected the battery, backup battery and Ram. When i pulled the back cover off i found 2 loose screws on the main board and one had fallen out of a wiring bracket that brought my attention to the broken USB port on one side that could possibly be my fault but i'd say there's a 5-8% chance. I've never dropped it, hit it, tossed it, loaned it to anyone, don't have kids, dogs or a cat and it's kept in a nice computer bag with me pretty much 24/7.

The only way to turn on the backlight is to press Fn+Spacebar. \r\nSpeakers are plenty loud, but they're on the bottom of the laptop.

I am getting about 10 fps more in the few games I play after the updates. Enough fps that my games are playable and enjoyable. \r\nThe computer feels very durable. I actually had a Thinkpad years ago when the IBM logo was still on the machines, and while playing with the demo at Bestbuy I joked about liking the retro look, but honestly I really liked the overall feel of the machine.

I have owned this Laptop for 2 months now, there have been no system Freeze or Crashes so far, it boots up fast and wakes up fast from sleep mode. The Laptop has a strong build, not flimsy or cheap, it has a rubber like non slip finish on the outside of it, a little on the heavy side but not really bad. The keyboard takes time to get used to, it has a shiny coating that makes it easy for your fingers to slip off the keys sometimes. The Battery life is horrible, around 3 hours. You can get a extended battery for 5-6 hour life, but be prepared to spend around $125 for it. Now the reason for the 3.5 stars, the screen display is very dull. It has a anti glare finish on the screen that gives the laptop not only a cheap look, a dull flat screen brightness even when you turn the brightness all the way up.. also dull screen colors...It has the 620 graphic display card that does not help the screen either. My laptop has a 4K display but when you compare it next to a 1080p laptop, with the regular shinny type screen, the 1080p laptop display looks better..I wish Lenovo could have been made the Think pad models without the dull anti glare screen like they do with the Yoga models.."}]}, {"information": {"price": "$79.99", "id": 38}, "review": [{"ProductId": 38, "time": "1 year ago", "rating": 4, "title": "Good laptop for the price", "content": "I needed a cheap but sturdy laptop at home for some freelance work.
